# perpass Pasword Manager
<p>basic cli based password manager in c++ that uses AES-256 encryption to store and manage account information</p>
<p>This project is for me to learn and use C++ practically</p>

- [x] Load encrypted passwords from a file
- [x] Add, remove, edit, and view password entries
- [x] Encrypt account info with AES using openSSL
- [x] Save encrypted passwords to a local file
- [x] Master key protection for accessing stored passwords
- [x] Add visual represenation


### Down the line
- Move storage method to DB
- Implement AES from scratch (simply for learning)
